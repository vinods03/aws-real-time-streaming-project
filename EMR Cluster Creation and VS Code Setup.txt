Created EMR Cluster with version 7.0.0 and only Spark 3.5.0, hadoop 3.3.6, JupyterEnterpriseGateway.

Use only one Primary node and one Core node and no scaling.

Used a Security group for the primary node that allows SSH traffic on port 22 (confirmed that this step is not needed)

Used the key pair "VinodEC2KeyPair.pem" from C:\Vinod that wwas copied over from C:\Vinod\0. From Sony Vaio\Study Material\AWS

I created a bootstrap script - s3://real-time-streaming-project-vinod/bootstrap.sh - and included this bootstrap action during the cluster creation
#!/bin/bash
sudo pip3 install boto3
boto3 is very much needed when working with AWS services.


==================================================== Shell / Unix Terminal Setup from VS Code to EMR cluster Master Node ===================================================

To connect to this cluster from VS Code:

Open VS Code Terminal, Ctrl+Shift+P -> Remote SSH - Open SSH Configuration File (use C:\Users\Vinod\.ssh\config)

Host vinod-cluster
  HostName ec2-35-171-4-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  IdentityFile C:\Vinod\VinodEC2KeyPair.pem
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  User hadoop

Then, again Ctrl+Shift+P -> Remote SSH -> Connect to Host
No error should be thrown

Then open a Terminal - New Terminal from top nav bar. 
You should be taken to the master node directly.

Note:
The permission on pem file was resulting in conenctivity errors:
Resolved by following the steps provided at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64687271/how-to-avoid-permission-denied-publickey-ssh-key-windows:
Right-click on the pem file -> Properties -> Security -> Advanced -> Disable Inheritance -> Select "Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object"
Remove all users
Add you alone with Full Control



================================================= Python setup from VS Code to EMR cluster Master Node =======================================================================


File -> New File -> hw.py

As soon as .py is seen, you might be prompted to install Python. 
If not prompted, go to "Extensions" -> Ctrl+Shift+P -> Python -> Install 
Or search and install Pylance and Pylance will install Python also. Pylance will help in prompting key words etc.
Also AWS boto3 (not sure if it is part of Python itself, anyway i installed AWS boto3 as well)

Now - write some simple print('hello world") (hw.py) -> Right-click and execute in Terminal 
Check "hello world" is getting printed.

Now - write another simple python program, this time using boto3 (hw1.py) -> -> Right-click and execute in Terminal 
Check the S3 bucket names are getting printed.
