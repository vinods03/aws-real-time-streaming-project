1. RedshiftData ExecuteStatement API: Move data from Redshift Staging to Redshift final:

{
  "ClusterIdentifier": "redshift-cluster-1",
  "Database": "ecommerce_db",
  "DbUser": "awsuser",
  "Sql": "call dev.enriched_orders_sp();"
}

2. RedshiftData DescribeStatement API: Get the Status of the Redshift Stored Procedure:

In Configuration, add:
{
  "Id.$": "$.Id"
}

The RHS $.Id is derived by looking at the output of a run.
The LHS Id.$ instead simply Id, is because Id here is an Input parameter and not a static value.

3. Choice State next.

Again by looking at a run's output, you can find out the parameter we need is Status and by looking at documentation, the status we need to wait & go back to "Get the Status of the Redshift Stored Procedure" is NOT $.Status == FINISHED

4. The default rule will ensure that once the above stored proc is completed, the Redshift vs S3 audit proc is triggered.
